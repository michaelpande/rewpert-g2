# Demo

To run the included simple demo application, you'll need [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

In the `jquery-iframe-transport` source directory, run:

    $ npm install

That should download and install all dependencies required for the build, including running the demo app. Then simply run:

    $ grunt connect

Point your browser to http://localhost:3000/ and you should be able to play with the demo.
